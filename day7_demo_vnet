  user ->access through ipaddress(firewallpublicipaddress):portno [4000] ->firewall bypass request to vm-> here nginx install ->run static html page

  vnet 
  divided into subnet
  -firewall ->additionally firewall management subnet
  -bastion(as we use vm private address)
  -default( deploy our vm)

  in vm - install ngnix -deploy static html page

  1)resource group
  2)vnet -bastion, firewall, add new policy in firewall
  3)vm [azure custom data -use at time of autoscaling, user data -persist in your vm  throughout  lifetime]

  {
  sudo su -
  apt update
  apt install nginx
  systemctl start nginx
  cd /var/www/html
  ls
  vim index.html [add your static html page]

    use dnat rules -network address translation rule
    add rule collection
      name-rule_coll_for_nginx
      priority-100 [least no=max priority, range 100-65000]
    add rule
      name-nginx_rule
      source type-ip address
      source -only through your laptop ip address [ all-*]
      destination ip address-firewall ip public address
      protocol-tcp
      destination port-4000
      translated type- ip address
      translated address-vm private address
      translated port-80
    {nginx run port 80- check bastion-curl localhost:80 [http 80, https 443]}
